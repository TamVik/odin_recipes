# odin_recipes
My first GitHub repo!
Hello Odin!
It's time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Warning!: the website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished.
We will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
