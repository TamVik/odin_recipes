    <p>Would you like something fresh and delicious? You should try Fruit salad.</p>
    <p>The perfect fruit salad for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it. Enjoy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, banana, orange, grapes, blueberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring orange juice, lemon juice and brown sugar to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Layer the fruit in a large, clear glass bowl in this order: pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries. Pour the cooled sauce over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
